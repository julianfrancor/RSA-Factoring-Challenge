## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What did I learn from this project:

* RSA Factoring Challenge
* Public-key encryption systems

---

### [0. Factorize all the things!](./factors)
* Factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers.


### [1. RSA Factoring Challenge ](./rsa)
* RSA Laboratories states that: for each RSA number n, there exist prime numbers p and q such that n = p Ã— q. The problem is to find these two primes, given only n.
